Outputs
=======

By default, Loads reports the status of the load in real time onthe standard
output of the client machine. Depending what you are trying to achieve, that
may or may not be what you want.

**Loads** comes with a pluggable "output" mechanism: it's possible to
define your own output format if you need so.

You can change this behaviour with the --output option of the `loads-runner`
command line.
