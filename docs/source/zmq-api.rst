Using loads in a different language
###################################

Loads is built in a way that makes it possible to have runners written in
different languages. It's perfectly possible to have a runner in javascript or
ruby, sending data to loads.

This is made possible by the use of `zeromq <http://zeromq.org/>`_ to send
inter-process (or even inter-machines!) messages.

This means you can write your load tests with whatever language you want, as
long as the test-runner sends back its results in the zmq pipeline, respecting
the format described in this document.

Implementations in other languages
==================================

* Integration of loads with javascript, named `loads.js
  <https://github.com/mozilla-services/loads.js>`_

Loads messaging format
======================

The messages sent to **loads** always contain a `data_type` key, which
describes the type of that that's being sent.

The messages respect the following rules:

- All the data is JSON encoded.
- Dates are expressed in `ISO 8601 format
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_, (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
- You should send along the agent id with every message. Each agent id should
  be different from each other.
- You should also send the id of the run.

A message generally looks like this::

    {
        data_type: 'something',
        agent_id: '1',
        run_id: '1234',
        other_key_1: 'foo'
        other_key_2: 'bar'
    }


loads_status
------------

Some messages take a `loads_status` argument. `loads_status` is a list of
values concerning the current status of the load. It contains, in this order:

- cycles: the number of cycles that will be running in total
- user: the number of users per cycle)
- current_cycle: the cycle we are currently in
- current_user: the current user that's doing the requests

errors / exceptions
-------------------

When errors / exceptions are caught, they are serialised and sent trough the
wire, as well. When you see an `exc *`, it is a list containing this:

- A string representation of the exception
- A string representation of the exception class
- The traceback / Stack trace.

Data types
==========

Before and after you run the tests, you need to tell that you're doing so:

- startTestRun()
- stopTestRun()


Tests
-----

When using loads, you usually run a test suite. Tests start, stop, succeed and
fail. Here are the APIs you can use:

- addFailure(test_name, `exc *`, loads_status)
- addError(test_name, `exc *`, loads_status)
- addSuccess(test_name, loads_status)
- startTest(test_name, loads_status)
- stopTest(test_name, loads_status)


Requests
--------

To track requests, you only have one method, named "add_hit" with the following parameters:

- `url`, the URL of the request, for instance http://notmyidea.org
- `method`, the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- `status`, the response of the call (200)
- `started`, the time when it started
- `elapsed`, the number of seconds (decimal) the request took to run
- loads_status, as already described

Sockets
-------

If you're also able to track what's going on with the socket connections, then
you can use the following messages:

- socket_open()
- socket_close()
- socket_message(size) # the size, in bytes, that were transmitted via the websocket.
