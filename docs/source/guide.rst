Using Loads with Requests
-------------------------

Let's say you want to load test the Elastic Search root page on your
system.

Write a unittest like this one and save it in an **example.py** file::

    from loads.case import TestCase

    class TestWebSite(TestCase):

        def test_es(self):
            self.session.get('http://localhost:9200')


The *TestCase* class provided by **Load** has a *session* attribute you
can use to interact with an HTTP server. It's a **Session** instance
from Requests.

Now run **loads-runner** against it::

    $ bin/loads-runner example.TestWebSite.test_es
    [======================================================================]  100%

    Hits: 1
    Started: 2013-06-14 12:15:42.860586
    Duration: 0.03 seconds
    Approximate Average RPS: 39
    Average request time: 0.01s
    Opened web sockets: 0
    Bytes received via web sockets : 0

    Success: 1
    Errors: 0
    Failures: 0


This will execute your test just once - so you can control it works well.

Now, try to run it using 100 virtual users (-u), each of them running the test
10 times (-c)::

    $ bin/loads-runner example.TestWebSite.test_es -u 100 -c 10
    [======================================================================]  100%
    Hits: 1000
    Started: 2013-06-14 12:15:06.375365
    Duration: 2.02 seconds
    Approximate Average RPS: 496
    Average request time: 0.04s
    Opened web sockets: 0
    Bytes received via web sockets : 0

    Success: 1000
    Errors: 0
    Failures: 0


Congrats, you've just sent a load of 1000 hits, using 100 concurrent threads.

Now let's run a series of 10, 20 then 30 users, each one running 20 hits::

    $ bin/loads-runner loads.examples.test_blog.TestWebSite.test_something --hits 20 -u 10:20:30

That's 1200 hits total.


Using Loads with ws4py
----------------------

**Loads** provides web sockets API through the **ws4py** library. You can
initialize a new socket connection using the **create_ws** method.

Run the echo_server.py file located in the examples directory, then
write a test that uses a web socket against it::


    from loads.case import TestCase

    class TestWebSite(TestCase):

        def test_something(self):
            def callback(m):
                results.append(m.data)

            ws = self.create_ws('ws://localhost:9000/ws',
                                callback=callback)
            ws.send('something')
            ws.receive()
            ws.send('happened')
            ws.receive()

            while len(results) < 2:
                time.sleep(.1)

            self.assertEqual(results, ['something', 'happened'])



Using Loads with WebTest
------------------------

If you are a **WebTest** fan, you can use it instead of Requests.
You just need to use **app** instead of **session** in the test class::

    from loads.case import TestCase

    class TestWebSite(TestCase):

        def test_something(self):
            self.assertTrue('Search' in self.app.get('/'))



Then you can define the server root url with **--server-url**
when you run your load test::

    $ bin/loads-runner example.TestWebSite.test_something --server_url http://localhost:9200

The **app** attribute is a `WebTest <https://webtest.readthedocs.org>`_ TestApp
instance, that provides all the APIs to interact with a web application.


Changing the server URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may happen that you need to change the server url when you're running the
tests. To do so, we provide a simple API::

    self.app.server_url = 'http://new-server'


Distributed test
----------------

If you want to send a lot of load, you need to run a distributed test.
The **Loads** command line is able to interact with several **agents**
through a **broker**.

To run a broker and some agents, let's use Circus.

Install Circus::

    $ bin/pip install circus

And run it against the provided **loads.ini** configuration file that's
located in the Loads source repository in **conf**::

    $ bin/circusd --daemon conf/loads.ini

Here is the content of the `loads.ini` file::

    [circus]
    check_delay = 5
    httpd = 0
    statsd = 1
    debug = 0

    [watcher:broker]
    cmd = bin/loads-broker
    warmup_delay = 0
    numprocesses = 1

    [watcher:agents]
    cmd = bin/loads-agent
    warmup_delay = 0
    numprocesses = 5
    copy_env = 1

What happened? You have just started a Loads broker with 5 agents.

Let's use them now, with the **agents** option::

    $ bin/load-runner example.TestWebSite.test_something -u 10:20:30 -c 20 --agents 5
    [======================================================================]  100%

Congrats, you have just sent 6000 hits from 5 different agents.


Detach mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are running in distributed mode a long test, you might want to detach
the console and come back later to check your load test.

You can simply hit Ctrl+C in order to do this. **Loads** will ask you if
you want to detach the console and continue the test, or simply stop it::


    [                                            ]   0%
    Duration: 2.04 seconds
    Hits: 964
    Started: 2013-07-22 07:12:30.139814
    Approximate Average RPS: 473
    Average request time: 0.00s
    Opened web sockets: 0
    Bytes received via web sockets : 0

    Success: 964
    Errors: 0
    Failures: 0

    Do you want to (s)top the test or (d)etach ? d


Then you can use **--attach** to reattach the console::

    $ bin/loads-runner --attach
    [                                       ]   4%
    Duration: 43.68 seconds
    Hits: 19233
    Started: 2013-07-22 07:12:30.144859
    Approximate Average RPS: 0
    Average request time: 0.00s
    Opened web sockets: 0
    Bytes received via web sockets : 0

    Success: 0
    Errors: 0
    Failures: 0

    Do you want to (s)top the test or (d)etach ? s


Running on Amazon Web Services
------------------------------

Running **Loads** on AWS requires you to have a dedicated AMI and security
group

**Loads** uses **boto** in order to provision new micro instances that will
be used as nodes to run the tests.
